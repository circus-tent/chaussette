Chaussette WSGI Server
======================

   :align: right


**Chaussette** is a WSGI server you can use to run your Python WSGI
applications.

The particularity of **Chaussette** is that it can either bind a socket
on a port like any other server does **or** run against **already opened
sockets**.

That makes **Chaussette** the best companion to run a WSGI or Django
stack in `Circus <http://circus.io>`_.


Usage
=====

You can run a plain WSGI application, a Django application, or a Paste application.
To get all options, just run *chaussette --help*.


Running a plain WSGI application
--------------------------------

**Chaussette** provides a console script you can launch against a WSGI
application, like any WSGI server out there:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ chaussette mypackage.myapp
    Application is <function myapp at 0x104d97668>
    Serving on localhost:8080
    Using <class chaussette.backend._wsgiref.ChaussetteServer at 0x104e58d50> as a backend


Running a Django application
----------------------------

**Chaussette** allows you to run a Django project. You just need to provide the
Python import path of the WSGI application, commonly located in the Django
project's ``wsgi.py`` file. For further information about how the ``wsgi.py``
file should look like see the `Django documentation`_.

Here's an example:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ chaussette --backend gevent mysite.wsgi.application
    Application is <django.core.handlers.wsgi.WSGIHandler object at 0x10ec3f350>
    Serving on localhost:8080
    Using <class 'chaussette.backend._gevent.Server'> as a backend

.. _`Django documentation`: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/howto/deployment/wsgi/

Running a Python Paste application
----------------------------------

**Chaussette** will let you run a project based on a
`Python Paste <http://pythonpaste.org/>`_ configuration file.

You just need to use to provide the
path to the configuration file in the **application**, prefixed with **paste:**

Here's an example:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ chaussette paste:path/to/configuration.ini
    $ Application is <mozsvc.middlewares.CatchErrorMiddleware object at 0x10d4fdad0>
    $ Serving on localhost:8080
    $ Using <class chaussette.backend._wsgiref.ChaussetteServer at 0x10cc7e668> as a backend


Using Chaussette in Circus
==========================

The typical use case is to run Chaussette processes in `Circus <http://circus.io>`_,
which takes care of binding the sockets and spawning Chaussette processes.

To run your WSGI application using Circus, define a *socket* section in your
configuration file, then add a Chaussette watcher.

Minimal example:

.. code-block:: ini

    [circus]
    endpoint = tcp://127.0.0.1:5555
    pubsub_endpoint = tcp://127.0.0.1:5556
    stats_endpoint = tcp://127.0.0.1:5557

    [watcher:web]
    cmd = chaussette --fd $(circus.sockets.web) --backend meinheld server.app
    use_sockets = True
    numprocesses = 5

    [socket:web]
    host = 0.0.0.0
    port = 8000


When Circus runs, it binds a socket on the *8000* port and passes the file descriptor
value to the Chaussette process, by replacing *${socket:web}* by the file number value.


Backends
========

Chaussette is just a bit of glue code on the top of existing WSGI servers,
and is organized around **back ends**.

By default Chaussette uses a pure Python implementation based on **wsgiref**,
but it also provides more efficient back ends:

- **gevent** -- based on Gevent's *pywsgi* server
- **fastgevent** -- based on Gevent's *wsgi* server -- faster but does not
  support streaming.
- **meinheld** -- based on Meinheld's fast C server
- **waitress** -- based on Pyramid's waitress pure Python web server
- **eventlet** -- based on Eventlet's wsgi server
- **geventwebsocket** -- Gevent's **pywsgi** server coupled with
  **geventwebsocket** handler.
- **geventws4py** -- Gevent's **pywsgi** server coupled with
  **ws4py** handler.


You can select your backend by using the **--backend** option and providing
its name.

For some backends, you need to make sure the corresponding libraries
are installed:

- **gevent** and **fastgevent**: `pip install gevent`
- **meinheld** : `pip install meinheld`
- **waitress** : `pip install waitress`
- **eventlet** : `pip install eventlet`
- **geventwebsocket**: `pip install gevent-websocket`
- **geventws4py**: `pip install ws4py`

Rationale and Design
====================

Most WGSI servers out there provide advanced features to scale your web
applications, like multi-threading or multi-processing. Depending on the
project, the *process management* features, like respawning processes that
die, or adding new ones on the fly, are not always very advanced.

On the other hand, Circus provides very advanced features to manage
your processes, and is able to manage sockets as well.

The goal of *Chaussette* is to delegate process and socket management to
Circus and just focus on serving requests.

Using a pre-fork model, Circus binds sockets and forks Chaussette processes
that are able to accept connections on those sockets, as child processes.
